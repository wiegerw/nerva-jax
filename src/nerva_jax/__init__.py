"""nerva_jax: Minimal neural network components built on top of JAX.

This package provides small, educational implementations of layers, activation
functions, loss functions, optimizers, learning-rate schedulers, softmax
utilities, and simple training helpers. It is designed for readability and
experimentation rather than performance.
