==== Command line options of {mlptool}
This section gives an overview of the command line interface of the `{mlptool}` tool.

===== Parameters lists

Some command line options take a list of items as input, for example a list of layers. These items must be separated by semicolons, e.g. `--layers="ReLU;ReLU;Linear"`.

===== Named parameters
Some of the items take parameters. For this we use a function call syntax with named parameters, e.g. `AllReLU(alpha=0.3)`. In case that there is only one parameter, the name may be omitted: `AllReLU(0.3)`. If the parameters have default values, they may be omitted. For example, `SReLU` or `SReLU()` is equivalent to `SReLU(al=0,tl=0,ar=0,tr=1)`.

===== General options

* `-?`, `-h`, `--help`
Display help information.

ifndef::no-cpp[]
* `--verbose`, `-v`
Show verbose output.
endif::no-cpp[]

* `--debug`, `-d`
Show debug output. This prints batches, weight matrices, bias vectors, gradients etc.

===== Random generator options
* `--seed <value>`
A seed value for the random generator.

===== Layer configuration options
* `--layers <value>`
A semicolon separated list of layers. For example, `--layers=ReLU;AllReLU(0.3);Linear` is used to specify a neural network with three layers with an ReLU, AllReLU and no activation function. The following layers are supported:
