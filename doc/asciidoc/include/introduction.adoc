== Introduction
The {library} is a library for neural networks.
It is part of the Nerva library collection https://github.com/wiegerw/nerva, that includes
native C++ and Python implementations of neural networks. Originally the library was intended
for experimenting with truly sparse neural networks. Nowadays, the library
also aims to provide a transparent and accessible implementation of neural networks.

This document describes the implementation of the {library}. For initial versions
of the library I took inspiration from lecture notes of
https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/teaching.html[machine learning courses by Roger Grosse], which I highly recommend.
This influence may still be evident in the naming of symbols.
