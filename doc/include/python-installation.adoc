== Installation

The {library} Python bindings provide access to the high-performance C++ backend of the Nerva neural network library. These bindings are built using `pybind11` and compiled with C++20. Installation is supported via `pip`, but requires several system-level dependencies to be available.

The installation process uses a https://github.com/wiegerw/nerva-rowwise/blob/main/python/setup.py[`setup.py`] script located in the `python` directory of the repository. This script requires certain environment variables to be set in order to locate the necessary libraries and headers.

=== Requirements

Before installing the Python bindings, ensure the following C++ libraries are available on your system:

- Intel oneMKL (for efficient linear algebra routines): https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html[oneMKL]
- FMT (header-only formatting library): https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt
- Eigen (header-only C++ linear algebra library): https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/
- pybind11 (for binding C++ to Python): https://github.com/pybind/pybind11

These libraries must be available as header files (and, for MKL, also as linkable libraries) at build time.

=== Environment Variables

The build system locates dependencies using the following environment variables:

[source,sh]
----
# Required for MKL
export MKL_ROOT=/opt/intel/oneapi/mkl/latest
# or use:
export ONEAPI_ROOT=/opt/intel/oneapi

# Required if not using CMake dependency resolution
export EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/eigen
export FMT_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/fmt/include
export PYBIND11_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/pybind11/include
----

If the `ONEAPI_ROOT` variable is set, the MKL path will be inferred as `$ONEAPI_ROOT/mkl/latest`. If you are on Windows, setting `ONEAPI_ROOT` is required to find the Intel OpenMP runtime (`libiomp5`).

=== Alternative: CMake Dependency Resolution

If you built the C++ library using CMake, you can optionally have FMT, Eigen, and pybind11 downloaded automatically via CMakeâ€™s `FetchContent` mechanism. These will be placed in the `_deps` subdirectory of the build directory.

To use the CMake-resolved dependencies, set the following environment variable:

[source,sh]
----
export CMAKE_DEPS_DIR=/path/to/cmake-build/_deps
----

This tells `setup.py` to look for the headers in:

- `CMAKE_DEPS_DIR/eigen-src`
- `CMAKE_DEPS_DIR/fmt-src/include`
- `CMAKE_DEPS_DIR/pybind11-src/include`

Refer to the link:nerva-cpp.html#cmake-build[CMake install] section in the C++ documentation for details.

=== Compiler Requirements

A C++17-compatible compiler is required. The installation has been tested with

- **Linux/macOS:** GCC 13+ or Clang 14+
- **Windows:** Visual Studio 2022 or later

The setup script uses OpenMP and links against MKL; make sure these are available on your platform.

=== Python Compatibility

The bindings are compatible with Python 3.12 and newer. Make sure your `pip` corresponds to a supported version of Python.

=== Installing the Python Module

To install the Python bindings, navigate to the `python` subdirectory of the repository and run:

[source,sh]
----
pip install .
----

This will build the native extension and install the `nerva` Python module. If any required environment variables are missing or incorrectly set, `setup.py` will raise an informative error.
