Note that the algorithm uses a number of event functions:
|===
|Event |Description

|`on_start_training`
|Is called at the start of the training

|`on_end_training`
|Is called at the end of the training

|`on_start_epoch`
|Is called at the start of each epoch

|`on_end_epoch`
|Is called at the end of each epoch

|`on_start_batch`
|Is called at the start of each batch

|`on_end_batch`
|Is called at the end of each batch
|===
The user can respond to these events by deriving from the class `{sgd_algorithm}`. Typical use cases for these event functions are the following:

- Update the learning rate.
- Renew dropout masks.
- Prune and grow sparse weights.

Such operations are typically done after each epoch or after a given number of batches.
// end::event-functions[]

// tag::event-actions[]
Five actions take place at the start of every epoch:

- A preprocessed dataset is loaded from disk, which is done to avoid the expensive computation of augmented data at every epoch.
- The learning rate is updated if a learning rate scheduler is set.
- Dropout masks are renewed.
- Sparse weight matrices are pruned and regrown if a regrow function is specified.
- Small weights in the subnormal range are clipped to zero if the `clip` option is set.
